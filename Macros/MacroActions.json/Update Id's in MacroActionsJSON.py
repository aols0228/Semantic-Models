# Description:
## Pythonscript that assigns new numerical id's to MacroActions.json
## MacroActions.json is the file that programs the model developers local macros through %localappdata%\TabularEditor3
## The reason for the script is due to the fact that I as a macro developer sometimes changes the order of the macros in the json-script itself.
## I then need to enumerate all the macros from 1...n again.
## This is tedious given that a macro could be moved from the end to the beginning and a hundred macros then need to have their Id's reassigned.
## Please note that the MacroActions.json have multiple lists within a dictionary with the key 'Actions'.
## Therefore we dynamically check if the macros are either in a list or in a dictionary.
## -------------------------
## The file path of the MacroActions.json script itself is dynamic according to the location of this script.
## This entails that you need to define the dynamic file path.
## This is especially useful if you like me have MacroActions in a model developer repo, with which you push macros, BPA's and layouts to model developers from a folder called e.g. Configurations Files.
## Then you can have this script located in an adjacent folder.
## -------------------------
## Please notice that python needs to be installed on your local machine.
## The script is most easily handled in Visual Studio Code with Python Extension fra Microsoft.
